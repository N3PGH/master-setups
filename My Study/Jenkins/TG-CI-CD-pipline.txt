Tools for CI/CD:Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis CI, BuildBot 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jenkins:

Jenkins is open source project written in java that runs on windows,macos 
and other unix-like opreting systems. It is free, community supported & 
might be your first choice tool for CI.
Jenkins automate the enter software developed by sun microsystem
in 2004 under the name hudson.
The project was later named jenkins when Oracle bought Microsystem.
It can run on any major paltform without any compatibility issues.
Whenever devolpers erite code, we integrate all that code of all 
developers at that point of time & we build, test & deliver/deploy to the client.
This process is called CI/CD.
Jenkins helps us to achive this because of CI, nows bugs will be reported
fast & get retified fast. So the entire software devlopment happens fast.

Workflow of Jenkins:
We can attach git, maven, selenium, & artifactory plugiins to jenkins.
Once developers puts that code &  send to maven for build.
Once build is done , jenkins pull that code  & send to selenium for 
testing.
Once tseting is done, jenkins pull that code & send to artiifactory as per 
requirment & so on.
We can also deploy with jenkins.

Advantages of Jenkins:
-IT has lots of plugins available.
-You can use community Plugin.
-You can write your own plugin.
-Jenskins is noot just a tool. It is a framework i.e, you can use whatever you want,
all you need is plugin.
-We can attach slaves (nodes) to jenkins master. it instruct other (slaves) to do job. 
If slaves are not available,jenkins itself does the job.
jenkins also behave as crone server replacement i.e, can do scheduled
task.
-It can create labels.
